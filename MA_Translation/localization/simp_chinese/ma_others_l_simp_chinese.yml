This new style particularly stands on its own in the cathedrals and castles that we are building in this fine land, masterpieces inspired, but not copied, from the ancient, classical ruins that the mighty romans have left us, with thick walls, round arches, sturdy pillars, barrel vaults, large towers and decorative arcadings.

 ma_artist.0095.h:0 "HISTORICAL CONTEXT - One of the most peculiar and ornate aspects of Romanesque church architecture was the tympanum. Situated over the entrance, it was often richly decorated by many statues. During the Gothic Era sculpture developed greatly but separately from architecture, and you could thus often find rows of new, Gothic style statues wrapped around an older Romanesque tympanum. Nonetheless, there were innovations in the style of the statues and decorations, with a more naturalistic approach and statues often more detached from the wall behind"

 ma_artist.0098.h:0 "HISTORICAL CONTEXT - In northern Europe, stained glass was an important and prestigious form of painting until the 15th century, when it became supplanted by panel painting. Gothic architecture greatly increased the amount of glass in large buildings, partly to allow for wide expanses of glass, as in rose windows. In the early part of the period mainly black paint and clear or brightly coloured glass was used, but in the early 14th century the use of compounds of silver, painted on glass which was then fired, allowed a number of variations of colour, centred on yellows, to be used with clear glass in a single piece. By the end of the period designs increasingly used large pieces of glass which were painted, with yellows as the dominant colours, and relatively few smaller pieces of glass in other colours"

That technique allowed the work to proceed slower than the fresco method as well brighter and more saturated colouring and had potential for more additional colours.

The guards have repeteadly told him to go back to the caravan, but he insists. Once I come closer and ask him to show me his wares, he reveals a number of beautiful rock crystal ewers, of incredible craftmanship and detail.

Named after its first creator, the great bishop Saint Donatus, it was however never meant to be, as lack of funds cut its construction short. \n\nNow that [GetPlayer.GetCouncillorPosition( 'councillor_court_chaplain' ).GetCouncillor.GetName] has finally come back from his journey to the great Palace in Aachen, taking note of its Palatine Chapel, I have finally been able to finish what was once started in a more glorious, magnificent form than ever thought before"
